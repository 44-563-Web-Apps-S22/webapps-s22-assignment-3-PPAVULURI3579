    <h1>Plano Phillie Phanatic</h1>

    <p>The Phillie Phanatic is the official mascot for the Philadelphia Phillies Major League Baseball team. He is a large, furry, green bipedal flightless bird[1] with an extendable tongue. He performs various routines to entertain fans during baseball games at Citizens Bank Park and makes public relation and goodwill appearances for the Phillies. The Phanatic is widely acknowledged as one of the best ballpark mascots,[2][3][4] and one of the most recognizable mascots in North American sports.[5</p>
